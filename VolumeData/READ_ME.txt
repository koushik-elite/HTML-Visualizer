This is an example of the VolumeData.js class and the EaselJS library being used to create a music visualizer with the HTML5 canvas element.

You cannot directly access volume data in JS, so the included VolumeData application allows you to export this data from any MP3 as text or encoded in a JPG image, which is then read by VolumeData.js.

To install the VolumeData application you must have the Adobe AIR runtime installed, then simply double click VolumeData.air. You can get the Adobe AIR runtime here:
http://get.adobe.com/air/
